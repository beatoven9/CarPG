--- Open Act I ---
--- Scene 1 ---
/*
    Player lies asleep in a field. Pan to Player's house. (Door sound and fade into the inside of the house.) 
    Player's dad is on the phone.
*/

Dad: Yes I know I know, I'm very sorry.
Telephone: Unfortunately Mr. Wheelson, you're apologies won't help your son to pass his Hive History class. You're weak! Your son must obey you!
Dad: What CAN I do to help him?
Telephone: At this point, the only thing that will allow him to pass Hive History and attend graduation next week is to complete extra credit.
Dad: Yes? What does he need to do?
Telephone: Rabble rabble rabble rabble...

/*
    Fade out into wide view of the house and pan over to the field where the Player lies asleep. He wakes up slowly.

    Player gets control of the car for the first time. Here in an empty field so that they can experiment with the controls.
    There should be plenty of fuel and boost restoring items scattered around so the player feels free to drive around here as much as they want.
    Eventually they do need to go home to see their dad. When the player leaves the field it will trigger their Dad calling out for them.
*/

Dad: PLAYER_NAME! Come on home!

/* 
    At this point, the Player must go straight home.
*/

Dad: PLAYER_NAME, I just got off of the phone with Mr. Gearwright. She said you missed class again today.
Dad: I know son, I know. I've known from the moment you were dropped on my doorstep that you would march to the beat of your own drum (Make this a car pun).
    I want you to follow your dreams. But I also want you to have a future. Mr. Gearwright said that you're failing behind in Hive History class. If you don't pass
    Hive History you won't be able to graduate and if you don't graduate you won't be able to get a job and contribute back to the Hive and they'll send you off to 
    the glue factory. And if you can't do it for yourself, do it for your little brother. He looks up to you. Imagine how heart broken he would be if this time next
    year he was building furniture with glue made from his older brother!
Dad: Now, the extra credit that Mr. Gearwright has assigned you...
// Dad describes Mr. Gearwright's quest.

/*
    Player regains control and completes quest.
*/

Dad: Wow! That was fast! You really are such a brilliant baby boy.
Dad: I'll call Mr. Gearwright right away! Now you get yourself ready for bed.

/*
    Player must go up to their room and interact with their bed. Your Dad enters.
*/

Dad: Mr. Gearwright says that you can graduate tomorrow! I know this doesn't mean much to you but it means so much to me and your brother that you won't be turned into glue!
Dad: Now get your rest!
// Dad rolls out of the room and the lights fade.

--- Scene II ---
/*
    The lights illuminate and PLAYER_NAME gets out of his bed.
*/

Inner monologue: I guess it's time to head over to the stadium for graduation!

/*
    Player regains control. Player must drive to the stadium. There will be a road that the player must travel on to get to the stadium. At a certain point along this road,
    a cutscene will be triggered.
*/

/*
    Player bumps into another car named FRIEND.
*/

FRIEND: Hey there PLAYER_NAME! Fancy meeting you out here, you here on your way to graduation too?

// Just then, a sudden commotion

Player's brother: HELLLLLPPP!!! He's trying to killlll meeeee!!!
FRIEND: PLAYER_NAME, is that your little brother?
Percy: (Brooklyn accent) Get back ovah here if ya know what's good foh ya!
FRIEND: Hey! Get away from him!
Player's brother: NOoOOOooO!!!!
// Player's brother is captured and taken behind a broken wall. Percy rolls back out. And looks at PLAYER_NAME
Percy: And you'll keep ya trap shut if you know what's good for YOU!
// Percy exits

FRIEND: We're gonna go after him, right?

/*

    PLAYER_NAME looks left, looks right, looks back, and then to the hole in the wall. He takes one more look at the road that leads to graduation (down).

*/
 
FRIEND: You're not seriously thinking of going to graduation after this. Right? Your brother has been car-jacked!

/*

    PLAYER_NAME slowly backs away from the road to graduation. Then quickly speeds forwards into a turn away from graduation and towards the hole in the wall.

*/

FRIEND: WOOT!
// He follows after PLAYER_NAME

/*
    Player regains control. there is a fork in the road. One side has rubble that you  can interact with.
*/

(Before reaching the dead end)
Rubble-interact: This rubble looks like it could be cleared away but I can't do anything about it now. If the other path in the fork doesn't lead anywhere, I'll see about having it cleared.

(After reaching the dead end)
Rubble-interact: This rubble looks like it could be cleared away. I should talk to the city about getting it cleared so I can continue my investigation.

/*
    PLAYER_NAME continues down the remaining paths at the fork in the road. The end of each fork will have some sort of task that will help the player make use of all of the different abilities.
    the final cutscene is triggered when the player enters the 'lobby' of the forks after having completed the final task.

    PLAYER_NAME exits from the hole in the wall to the scene in which he made his decision to be late to his graduation.
*/

FRIEND: Wait... is it dark out already? What time is it? Oh no! XX:XX! That is so late! We only have XX:XX to get there before your name is called.

/*
    Timer starts and PLAYER_NAME has to use his newly acquired skills to try and get to his graduation on time. The streets are empty because everyone is at the graduation. Just try beat the 
    clock and not get totalled.

    3-4 tiers to the timer. In each bracket, PLAYER_NAME is rewarded something different depending on how late they were to their own graduation. Each tier will trigger a slightly different
    cutscene, but ultimately they will all result in your dad being disappointed in you for being late to the graduation.

--------(LONGEST TIME)
    // Arrives at stadium
    FRIEND: Oh no... everyone's gone.
    // Player needs to pilot PLAYER_NAME back home. Using gas on the trip is the penalty for the bad time on the quest.

    /*
        Dad is sitting on the porch alone.
    */

    FRIEND: Mr. Wheelson?
    Dad: ...
    FRIEND: Mr. Wheelson.. We're sorry.
    Dad: ...
    Dad: You're sorry.
    Dad: That's okay. 
    Dad: I understand it's hard for you. 
    Dad: But please understand that it's hard for me too.
    Dad: I was the only father in that audience who didn't have a son on that stage.
    Dad: ...
    PLAYER_NAME: ...
    Dad: And also, your brother has been missing for hours. This is the worst day so far this week. One of my sons is missing, the other is going to be turned into glue.
    Dad: Now I'm going to have to make a request of the Queen to find one of my sons and spare the other!
    // Dad walks inside.


--------(SHORTEST TIME)
    // Arrives at stadium just in time to have his name called. He was out of breath.
    SPEAKER_DUDE: PLAYER_NAME! 
    //PLAYER_NAME rushes on stage at the last second
    PLAYER_NAME: *pant* *cough* *wheeze*
    //PLAYER_NAME takes diploma and rolls off screen.
    //Empty stadium PLAYER_NAME goes up to his dad in audience.
    Dad: You made it! I was worried there for a moment.
    FRIEND: Oh.. uh yeah! We were here! Just took a bit longer to get our grills done than we thought.
    Dad: I'm the happiest Father in the world for you to have been there. I don't care if you barely made it!
    // the three walk home together. in mid conversation.
    FRIEND: Yeah and then bumped into each other right before the accident...
    Dad: Oh you didn't tell me you saw an accident. What happened?
    FRIEND: Oh yeah, your youngest son was car-jacked.
    Dad: No he did not.. He stayed home safe with the babysitter. And anyway, car-jacking only happens in movies. You know that. Cars aren't able to bring intentional harm to other cars. It's part of our hive DNA!
    FRIEND: I promise that's what we saw! We even saw where they went! But one of the paths was blocked off so we couldn't check everywhere!
    Dad: You couldn't check everywhere?
    Dad: Is this why you were almost late to your graduation??
    // Babysitter races out of house.

    Babysitter: BROTHER!! Where are you?
    Dad: Don't worry, he'll turn up, we just need to inquire with the Queen to find out where he is. She know all.


/*
    Player is allowed to explore the city at night. Quite a lot is closed because it's night but the player can still ride around and test out their car which has been upgraded due to the graduation?
    When the Player is ready, they just need to go to sleep in their bed in order to trigger the next cutscene.

    PLAYER_NAME wakes up. Dad can be talked to.
*/

// PLAYER_NAME leaves his house.
// FRIEND rolls up

FRIEND: Ok, so all I need to do is go to the city building to talk to someone about getting that road cleared!

// Player regains control to go to the city building. Side quests are available along the way.
// Player enters City building. Goes up to the reception desk.

Receptionist: Can I help you?
FRIEND: Yes thank you, we're looking to report debris blocking off the road.
Receptionist: How many?
FRIEND: How many?
Receptionist: How many roads is the debris blocking off, Honey?
FRIEND: How many roads?... well, just one road.
Receptionist: Just one road?? Oh Honey, I'm sorry but you'll have to file a request and we're totally backlog with reports like this recently. We are barely keeping afloat here. The queen works 
    in mysterious ways!!
FRIEND: Please! Is there any way you to get priority?
Receptionist: I'm sorry, the only people who have the authority to sign a report as a priority is the governor of the city.
FRIEND: So we need a signature from the governor...
// PLAYER_NAME and FRIEND roll away.
Receptionist: That's not what I meant!!

// Player takes control and finds the governor's house.
// FRIEND beeps at the door.
// No one answers the door.

Sounds from house: REevvvvv! HONK! RubbleRubble!

Sounds from house: HIIIRraaaYaaaAA revvv yraa yraaaa vroooom!

// Player follows noises up the stairs.
// Walks into the governor and another car in a bed together.
Governor Gearson: WHAT ARE YOU TWO BOYS DOING IN HERE!
FRIEND: Oh.. we were checking to see if you needed any help!
Governor Gearson: We don't! So get out!
FRIEND: Well, we were also wondering if you could hear a proposal.
Governor Gearson: WHAT?!?!
FRIEND: Well, there's this road down the street that --
Governor Gearson: NO! Get out!
// PLAYER_NAME starts to drive away.
Governor Gearson: WAIT!
Governor Gearson: Are your dashcams recording?..
Governor Gearson: Give me the recordings.
FRIEND: Hear our proposal and we will.
Governor Gearson: I don't negotiate with terrorists!

**** First boss battle ensues ****

// Governor Gearson is defeated.
Gov. Gearson: I have to admit. You two are quite impressive fighters. Your style almost reminds me of... no that's nonsense. Anyway, I'll hear your proposal. But you'll have to promise me that you won't show those 
    videos to ANYONE. Trust runs both ways.
FRIEND: You've got yourself a deal!
Gov. Gearson: So what is it that you boys want?
FRIEND: Well there's an old blocked road that we really want to investigate but it will take months in the regular queue and we need to investigate it NOW!
Gov. Gearson: Which road are we talking about here boys?
FRIEND: right at the entrance to Train Drive.
Gov. Gearson: The entrance to Train Drive?...
// Gov. Gearson flabbergasted.
Gov. Gearson: Why would you two want to remove that rubble?..
FRIEND: Well...
Gov. Gearson: You don't know!
FRIEND: Know what?
Gov. Gearson: That's it! Have I got something to show you boys! Race ya to the rubble. Keep up if ya can!

FRIEND: NOOOOO!!! Governor Gearson!!
// Gov. Gearson drives through the rubble without interacting with it at all.
FRIEND: What happened? Where is he? I thought for sure we were about to watch an auto-murder...
// Gov. Gearson exits slowly from the rubble.
Gov. Gearson: HAHAHAH! You should have seen the looks on your grills!
PLAYER_NAME: WHAT!!!?
Gov. Gearson: It's an illusion. You can drive right through it! Come on! Follow me!
// FRIEND barrels through the fake rubble.
// PLAYER_NAME carefully drives closer to the rubble and slowly through it.
// Black screen
Gov. Gearson: Welcome to Underton!
// Black screen illuminates to a bustling city square
