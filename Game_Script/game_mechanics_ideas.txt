*Fuel is necessary to get anywhere. If you run out of fuel, you are towed to a gas station of your choosing for a price. The price is determined by distance. Can't travel to a gas station you haven't been to yet.
*Overworld enemies drive around and you encounter them by running into them. If you run into the enemy with the front of your car
the enemy will start the battle having taken damage. You will also have taken some damage. Battering rams are available for purchase.
Better battering rams offer less damage to user and more damage to enemy. Speed at time of impact also affects damage taken/dealt. When 
you hit another car you can choose whether to fight and the winner pays for ALL damages, or you just pay for damages based roughly on 
who was at fault but your insurance premium will go up.
*Encounters are turn based. Magic power is based on your boost power. Magic gauge is based on your boost capacity/duration.
attack stat raises with each level and also with what kind of battering ram you put on.
*End of day, you get a bill for existing. Insurance, registration, etc. You can drive without a registration but police will chase you
and you need to pay an obscene fine or fight them. They will be super powerful and just impossible to beat in the early game.

shifter. Actually shifts you through gears.
You start out with two gears. Slow and medium. At the end of some early quest (maybe tutorial), you're 
gifted with a 3rd gear. 
Gears will work like this.
    You can click up sequentially by holding shift and then clicking with the mouse.
    When you let off of the accelerator, the gear goes down one. When you press the back arrow,
        you're taken out of gear completely.
        (All of this backwards for in reverse)

Or

Right click up shift, left click down shift, boost is the shift key and can only be accessed once in top gear. However,
when not in the top gear, the left shift key will also upshift you.
Maybe there will be a slight cool-down for shifts. As you progress in the game and are awarded shifts, you're also awarded
decreases in cool-down time for shift changes.
