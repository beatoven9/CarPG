Your friend car who you've known since birth is neither human nor car but a being like the one who talks to you in the prologue. The friend's consciousness was sent into a car
to be your companion.

At some point for some quest, you will venture out to into an abandoned area and you will be surprised to find an ancient queen egg. Maybe it will be an egg from a different 
blood-line than the current queen and more resistant to the corruption plaguing the current queen.
