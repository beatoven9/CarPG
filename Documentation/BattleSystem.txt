BATTLE SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION

	########### BattleScene.gd ###########
		load_enemy_data() and load_player_data()
			These are mostly placeholder methods right now.
			We will need a way to load in this data along with the player item list data. (inventory system is placeholder for now)

			Each one returns a list of fighters of the format:
				var player_fighter2 = {
					"name": "Wheely",
					"texture": Texture2D,
					"attack": 15,
					"defense": 15,
					"magic": 15,
					"magic_defense": 15,
					"speed": 20,
					"luck": 5,
					"vitality": 10,
					"fighter_class": ThiefClass,
					"class_proficiency": 30,
					"max_health": 500,
					"max_boost": 100,
					"boost_per_sec": 2,
					"health_per_sec": 0,
					"weapon_bonus": 10,
					"armor_bonus": 10,
					"inventory": ["coins", "coins", "pocket lint", "anal beads"],
					"snatchable_inventory": ["coins", "coins", "pocket lint", "anal beads"]
				}

		_ready()
			This method uses the Player list, Enemy list, and item list and calls the 
			BattleEngine.gd script's start_engine() method.

		---THE MOVE QUEUE---
			The move queue is the heart of the BattleEngine.

			When a Fighter is ready to make a move, it will emit the ready_to_move signal.
			This signal is received by the BattleEngine's request_move(Fighter) method.
			This method then pauses all of the Fighters' battle_timers, calls the Fighter's
			request_move(battle_state) method.

			When the Fighter's move has been selected, the move_ready signal is emitted.
			This signal is caught by the BattleEngine's receive_move_info(move_info) method.

			----receive_move_info(move_info)----
				This method receives a move_info object
				It pushes this object to the back of the move_queue and then calls execute_move()

			----execute_move()---
				This method checks to see if the length of the move_queue is greater than 0
					if it is, it pops the move off of the queue and then calls BattleEngine.apply_move(move_info)
						with the move_info object it popped off of the move_queue
					if it is not, it simply returns from the function.

			----apply_move(move_info)----
				-This method uses the move_info["user"].fighter_luck property to determine
				how many rolls the move's user gets for critical hits and successful hits.
				-It then rolls that many times for random floats between 0 and 1.
				-It takes the lowest of those rolls and saves them.
				-Then the move_announcer and resume_timers values are set on the move_info object
					(This could be set in the gen_move_info() method if we get a 
					 reference to the BattleEngine in the Fighter object)
				-Then the Move.use_move(move_info, success_roll, crit_roll) method is called
				-At this point, the BattleEngine is in a waiting state until the BattleEngine.on_move_complete() 
				 method is called when the move has completed.

			----on_move_complete()----
				-The on_move_complete method really has two purposes.
					-resume the battle_timers
					-attempt to execute another move in case there is a move in the queue.

	Fighter.gd
		DamageHUD.gd
			-This is a scene which is a child of every Fighter.
			-It displays damage/healing when a move is used.
			-it is interfaced with by using the display_damage(damage_inflicted, critical) and
			 display_healing(healing_amount) methods.
			-These methods are called at the end of the Fighter.receive_move() method

		FighterHUD.gd
			-This is a scene which is a child of every PlayerFighter.
			-It displays the health, boost, and timer of each fighter.
			-It gets updated using the Fighter.update_hud() method.

		battle_timer.gd
			-This timer, which is a child of each Fighter has a length set based on the Fighter's speed
			-When this timer runs out, the ready_to_move signal is emitted and caught by the 
			 BattleEngine.request_move() method.

		receive_move(move_info)
			-This method is used to handle receipt of a move when the Fighter is the target of an attack.	
			-For most attacks, this is called at the end of the attack animation and just handles calculating
			 damage dealt.
			-For magic attacks, this method also handles playing the animated_sprite associated with a particular
			 spell.
			-the on_move_complete() method is called from the base_spell_hit.gd script when the animation is complete.
