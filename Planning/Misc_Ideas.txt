It would be hugely beneficial to come up with backstories for all of the other characters. And
maybe a more abstract piece about the relationships between all the party members. Maybe a short story
for some of them.

I need to split up Wheely into two separate people. There's no reason why the player character can't speak.
You'll be able to select who you move around in the overworld with. You can be anyone. But he needs a name
and a personality.
