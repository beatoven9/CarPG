*The big reveal that there are actually humans in the cars in Underton.*
One of the mainline quests will result in FRIEND and PLAYER_NAME getting drunk with a group of Underton citizens. One of the citizens is so drunk that he can't drive. His friends call him a Tow-ber for a tow.
The friend insists on proving that he's not drunk by driving around really fast. He hits a tree stump and the human inside of the car comes flying out of the car and SPLATs on a wall. The other humans get out
of their cars to run up to the deceased's remains. They turn to PLAYER_NAME and FRIEND and ask what they're still doing in their car. Someone has died ( or, We have to try to save him! Ok this is a piece of his head right here. Is that an elbow?)! FRIEND turns to PLAYER_NAME. "What are those things? 
And how did they just get out of those cars? Oh my god, I think the cars they were in are dead. Hello? Hellllooo?! We need to get out of here, PLAYER_NAME!!" This will be a turning point in the story. From this
point on, all of the cars in Underton will be hostile. Maybe the shops are still functional though? They still like money? lol
Humans from the future came to a planet populated by old retro cars.
