We should have a class generator and a move generator.

a json file of the form:

{
	"class_name": "BlackMageClass",
	"move_list": [
		{
			"move_name": "Fire",
			"base_power": 90,
			"move_type": "black_magic_attack",
			"friendly": false,
			"elemental_damage": "fire",
			"bp_cost": 15,
			"crit_rate": 1.0,
			"steal_item": false,
		},
		{
			"move_name": "Frost",
			"base_power": 90,
			"move_type": "black_magic_attack",
			"friendly": false,
			"elemental_damage": "frost",
			"bp_cost": 15,
			"crit_rate": 1.0,
			"steal_item": false,
		},
		{
			"move_name": "Shock",
			"base_power": 90,
			"move_type": "black_magic_attack",
			"friendly": false,
			"elemental_damage": "shock",
			"bp_cost": 15,
			"crit_rate": 1.0,
			"steal_item": false,
		},
	]
}

We should also have a move generator. This will create just the move file. I think this will speed up development. We will
still have to create animations for each new move. There might be a way to automate that as well. Maybe each move has a 
base animation based on the type. And the "animation_intensity" tag in the json file modifies some value on that animation
that will show that it was a bigger move. For spells, the particle effects could be more intense. For combat moves, maybe 
the animation is just faster or slower depending. Or gun moves just last longer

json file of the form:

{
	"move_name": "Shock",
	"base_power": 90,
	"move_type": "black_magic_attack",
	"friendly": false,
	"elemental_damage": "shock",
	"bp_cost": 15,
	"crit_rate": 1.0,
	"steal_item": false,
}
