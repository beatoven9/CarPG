Your friend car who you've known since birth is neither human nor car but a being like the one who talks to you in the prologue. The friend's consciousness was sent into a car
to be your companion.

At some point for some quest, you will venture out to into an abandoned area and you will be surprised to find an ancient queen egg. Maybe it will be an egg from a different 
blood-line than the current queen and more resistant to the corruption plaguing the current queen.

The camera during gameplay must be panned far out of course. however, it would be awesome if the camera zoomed in (velocity is an s-curve). It could really show the pixels and maybe
some cool particle effects for the exhaust and such.


The queen flew too close to the Sun. experimented with some sort of magic/alien-mech to enhance her power. And either the magic overtakes her and she's possessed by something nasty, or 
perhaps more fitting... the alien-mech was created with malicious intent, unbeknownst to the queen... This alien-mech overtakes her and essentially possesses her. And 



It would be so funny if when the queen is attacking you as the final boss one, you say, "There must be someway to reverse this!" and the being that possessed the queen says, "There is no
way to reverse this!", And then the fight ensues.... you can either fight her, or throw a potion at her and she gets healed. It would require a branch in the story line after that but it 
should be mostly over at that point already.
