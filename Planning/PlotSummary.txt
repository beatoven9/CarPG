Okok the planet is gonna be like a hive planet. Where there's a queen car that gives birth. 
And the new born cars are raised by families with a single father and no mother. Since all 
beings on the planet are part of the same hive, things go really smoothly, like in the hit 
animated movie starring Jerry Seinfeld, bEEs! Except for the main character who is a little 
maverick. Often goes against the grain, is clumsy, and becomes an outcast. His father car 
still loves him tho.       Then......

Weird shit starts going down in this peaceful car planet. There are reports of rogue cars 
being evil and shit.

And the player is trying to solve it even though orders from the queen are that everything 
is under control. The player finds out that aliens (humans) are coming and harvesting cars 
by removing their sentience and sending them back to Earth.

The player goes to reveal it to the queen and it turns out that the Queen not only knew about 
it, but she was running it, had cut a deal with the humans so that she could raise money to 
expand to other start systems and improve their chances of survival by becoming a 
multi-planetary species. So she's the boss battle.

Oh! Another cool twist would be that the player character is actually a human consciousness 
injected into a car as an experiment by the Queen and Humans to see if it would be more 
profitable to sell cars to people or to put people's consciousness in the car. It turns out 
that Honeysuckle doesn't smell quite as nice as a car so it wasn't commercially viable. This 
would also explain why the player doesn't fit into the hive planet very well. Because he's 
actually human.
