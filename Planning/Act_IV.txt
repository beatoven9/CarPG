Act IV

final boss is the queen
You eventually gain audience with the queen.

Wheely: Your majesty, we come to you with heavy hearts.
Wheely: For we have seen fellow cars reduced to shells of their former selves.
Wheely: Cars who have had their consciousnesses ripped out so their empty carcasses could 
	be sold on other planets to collectors.

// Music fades to silence. All is silent.

Queen: ...

Wheely: Your majesty?

// audible footsteps, If I decide to make BIGBAD a humanoid

BIGBAD: She can't hear you, you know?
BIGBAD: Unfortunately, your dear queen has also been reduced to... what were your words? An "empty carcass"?

Wheely: NOOOO!!!
All: // Shouts out of despair

BIGBAD: And how fitting will it be for her to be the one to take you lot out of your misery?

// hand extends from cloak *snaps* 
// queen attacks

// you defeat the queen.
Queen: YIEAHHHOOHSHSH!!!!!
// Queen starts bashing around and the whole room starts shaking.

Percy: We've gotta get out of here! This whole cave system is about to collapse!

// You race off to the exit.
// As you make it out of the cave, all party members kind of spread out a bit to catch their breath and ninja
// cars swoop in as dark blurs and carjack each one of the players. When PLAYER_CAR gets swooped, the screen goes black.
