The dynamic loading of FighterHUD components is good. Instead of just having a generic margin container in the Battlescene, we should have a FighterHUDParent scene. This will have the labels for Health, Boost, Timer. 

We should also have one parent margin container for the whole battle UI.

We should also have the move selection box allow switching between enemy and party targets.
