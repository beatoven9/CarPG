First step in developing this is to build an ATB machine that has very basic hardcoded fighter data. 
(Texture, fighter_name)
    -Create ATB meters that have real timers and will call a method called "request_move()" on the Fighter.
        This method will merely print("Fighter {fighter_name} made their move")
    -Add more hardcoded data that will populate each Fighter class (Add basic FighterClass class)


How do the fighters know when they should be highlighted?? (during dialogue box selection)
	This is actually easy enough since we have references to each fighter in the battle state
	connect a function that highlights the selected player to the signal for when the selection changes
How should sub boxes be handled?

Attack - just a normal melee attack
Magic - fire, ice, thunder, etc (This will double for black, blue mage)
Necromancy - This is available for necromancers that already have their beast raised. It is a move list of the raised.
Abilites - repair, steal, jump
Item - usable items in this list
