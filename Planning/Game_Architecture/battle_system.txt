First step in developing this is to build an ATB machine that has very basic hardcoded fighter data. 
(Texture, fighter_name)
    -Create ATB meters that have real timers and will call a method called "request_move()" on the Fighter.
        This method will merely print("Fighter {fighter_name} made their move")
    -Add more hardcoded data that will populate each Fighter class (Add basic FighterClass class)
