overhauled user prompt box has just been completed as has the back functionality.

So the dialogue box on the bottom right tells the moves as they are happening. Including failures and crit notifs.
This needs to be linked in with signals from the ends of animations too...

The move itself should have a get_attack_string(user_name, target_name, critical, success) method that returns 
a string to be fed to the dialogue box.

when updating the dialogue box, we will get the current string and then add the new string to the front with a few
newlines in between and set that as the new text. We will probably also have to put this label inside a vertical
scrolling container






Dialogue box basically done:
	next
		--- Add generate_announcement_string() to Moves
				It would be cool if this had a large pool of randomized phrases about how great, mediocre, or bad
				a move was. Maybe chatGPT generated. A huge list.





I think, magic learned while using a class weapon is retained when you don't have the weapon equipped
	but it is much less powerful and much less boost efficient might be cool. So it's still useable.


I think I'm gonna make blue mage more intuitive. There's gonna be some sort of pokedex type of thing for 
learnable moves. So when you see a learnable move is used, you get a notification that it is learnable
and your move_dex is updated. When you look through your move dex, you can see all the moves you've seen
with the monsters that can learn them. Maybe there could be a move dex and a monster dex.
