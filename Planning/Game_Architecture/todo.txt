overhauled user prompt box has just been completed as has the back functionality.

So the dialogue box on the bottom right tells the moves as they are happening. Including failures and crit notifs.
This needs to be linked in with signals from the ends of animations too...

The move itself should have a get_attack_string(user_name, target_name, critical, success) method that returns 
a string to be fed to the dialogue box.

when updating the dialogue box, we will get the current string and then add the new string to the front with a few
newlines in between and set that as the new text. We will probably also have to put this label inside a vertical
scrolling container






Dialogue box basically done:
	next
*done*		--- *Add attack, magic, (handiness? prolly just uses magic), defense, and magic-defense stats to the battle system.
*done*			*Add mechanic class with some healing spells
*done*			*Create moves that utilize these stats. I think it would be good to put the "calculate_move_damage"
*done*			methods on the base move. We could have different ones for offensive_magic, defensive_magic, healing magic, 
*done*			melee, long_range
*done*			*each method will take a user, a target, and the success_roll. It will use the relevant stats from each one 
*done*			to calculate the appropriate damage and determine if the success roll was high enough. it will return a 
*done*			dictionary of form:
*done*
*done*			var move_result = {
*done*				move_string: "",
*done*				damage_output: 90,
*done*			}
*done*
*done*				it could just apply the move to the target itself. however, this would make it hard to handle animations and all.
*done*
*done*		--- Add generate_announcement_string() to Moves
*done*				It would be cool if this had a large pool of randomized phrases about how great, mediocre, or bad
*done*				a move was. Maybe chatGPT generated. A huge list.


		--- Get the bars to lerp. maybe there is a "real_value" and a "displayed_value" on the fighter_hud for each bar.
			in the _process() method, the "displayed_value" is always lerping toward the "real_value"


		--- Write documentation for the BattleEngine so that I can understand it a month from now.



I think, magic learned while using a class weapon is retained when you don't have the weapon equipped
	but it is much less powerful and much less boost efficient might be cool. So it's still useable.


I think I'm gonna make blue mage more intuitive. There's gonna be some sort of pokedex type of thing for 
learnable moves. So when you see a learnable move is used, you get a notification that it is learnable
and your move_dex is updated. When you look through your move dex, you can see all the moves you've seen
with the monsters that can learn them. Maybe there could be a move dex and a monster dex.
