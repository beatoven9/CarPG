overhauled user prompt box has just been completed as has the back functionality.

next, I should create one or two more FighterClasses for testing Magic and a few more abilities.
	include Boost/PP usage in this process

I also need to add player names to the move selection box.

I think, where magic learned while using a class weapon is retained when you don't have the weapon equipped
	but it is much less powerful and much less boost efficient might be cool. So it's still useable.


I think I'm gonna make blue mage more intuitive. There's gonna be some sort of pokedex type of thing for 
learnable moves. So when you see a learnable move is used, you get a notification that it is learnable
and your move_dex is updated. When you look through your move dex, you can see all the moves you've seen
with the monsters that can learn them. Maybe there could be a move dex and a monster dex.
