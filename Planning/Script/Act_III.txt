---Act III---
---scene i---

	// The team enters the gates of the city.

Gov Gearson: We're here! Ok, he lives on the far side of town in an inn called The Spare Tire. 

	// The team explores the city and eventually makes its way to The Spare Tire

Gov Gearson: Hey Keepa! I'm an old friend of Carisco. Can you remind me which room he's in?

Barkeep: Course! He's on the second floor at the end of the hall! Just had a group of visitors this morning.
	a couple blue cars. real sporty looking (describing big bad's lackeys.)

	// Music stops

Gov Gearson: What?

	// Regain player control. You wheel to Carisco's room and enter the room (All with no music)
	// The friend is nowhere to be seen and there's a small car crying that attacks. Maybe the music should be more sad or dramatic here. maybe mourning and anger.

Tinaldo: GET OUT!!!!!!

	// Tinaldo raises two rust golems for you to fight
	// This should be pretty tough. Once you beat the rust golems Tinaldo breaks down crying.

Tinaldo: Ahhh where did you take him??

Gearson: We didn't take anyone anywhere, are you talking about those blue cars? We are not with them. 
	I'm a friend of Carisco.
	We were coming to say hi. You must be... his son?

Tinaldo: ...

Wheely: You don't have to worry! Those blue cars are our enemies too! We're trying to put an end to all of this violence.

Frogg: Blurgh!

Tinaldo: I want to come with you!

Wheely: No no no, you're wayyy too young!

Tinaldo: AM NOT!!

Wheely: YEAH HUH!

Gearson: Wait wait wait wait!
Gearson: Normally I would agree with you... But weren't you also just a little bit impressed by the strength of those 
	rust golems he just raised?

Wheely: I guess so...

Gearson: I've seen the kinds of magic his father is capable of and he obviously has been teaching him. He could be a huge help
	in saving your brother and his father.

Wedge: Ok! You're in!

Wheely: But you have to do what we say!

Tinaldo: No way!

Wedge: You don't have to do what he says... Just be safe and helpful.

Tinaldo: You don't have to worry about that! You won't know how you ever survived without me!

	// Tinaldo joins your party as a necromancer.

---scene ii---

Wedge: Now, where to from here?

Tinaldo: I overheard the blue cars talking about a hangar.

Gearson: A hangar, huh? There's really only one hangar in Westerton skeevy enough for Percy...
Gearson: And it does happen to be in East Westerton.

##################################################################
	It's night when you walk out.
	On the way, you're forced to walk through this square with some drunk people in it. 
	One of them is driving in circles.
##################################################################

CAR 1: Hey! Slow down! You're way too drunk! We need to call you a tow-truck!

CAR 2: NO WAY! I feel great!

	// CAR 2 continues driving in circles then drives into a stump or a rock and a human flies out of the front windshield and 
	// into a wall. 

thing that came out of CAR 2: *SPLAT*

CARS: Oh my god! Oh no!

	// Humans get out of their cars.

thing that came out of CAR 1: What are you doing just sitting in your car? Get out and help!

Wheely: What the flip is that?

	// Wheely wheels over to the empty car with the cracked windshield.

Wheely: Is he dead? Hello?

thing that came out of CAR 1: What? Stop joking around!
thing that came out of CAR 1: Ok I think this is a piece of his head. Is that an elbow?

Wheely: We gotta get out of here...

##################################################################
	En route to the hangar you see Percy and Tony bringing Carisco and Wedge's brother down the road.
	You follow behind.
	
	You eventually make it up to the hangar doors. 
	You enter and there are boxes in front of you blocking you from being seen.
	The screen pans up to reveal Percy, Tony, Carisco, and Wedge's brother in the middle of the large hangar.
	There is a conveyor belt of cars being transported along the back wall.
	A portal opens up and a humanoid in a black cloak walks out of it.
##################################################################

BIG_BAD: So, you've acquired the two cars I requested?

Percy: Of course, you're excellency.

BIG_BAD: Let me see...

	// Music stops.

BIG_BAD: you fool.

Percy: Pardon?

BIG_BAD: YOU FOOL! This... this is not the right Wheelson!

Percy: I know.

	// Percy strikes BIG_BAD and BIG_BAD blocks the attack effortlessly. Percy is thrown into a wall.

Tony: Ahhh!!!

	// Tony drives directly at BIG_BAD and also gets cast aside.

BIG_BAD: Pitiful. 

	// BIG_BAD walks over to Carisco

BIG_BAD: You're the mage?

Carisco: Y-y-yes...

BIG_BAD: Your services will be of assistance.

		// BIG_BAD turns to Wedge's brother.

BIG_BAD: You aren't worth my time.

##################################################################
	BIG_BAD and Carisco exit through the portal which then closes up.

	The camera pans back to your character and you regain control.
	Character with highest proficiency points in the mechanic class that isn't Wedge goes to heal Percy and Tony.
	Wheel over to your brother. When you get close enough to you he sees you.
##################################################################

Wedge's brother: Wedge!?

Wedge: You're safe now!

	// Percy and Tony wheel back with your mechanic expert.

Percy: Thanks so much fellas. And I'm sorry about all the carjacking and murdering I've been doing.

Wedge: Yeah, that wasn't cool.

Percy: But I've changed. I discovered things about Overton that you wouldn't believe. It's bigger than any of us. I need to fix it.

Wheely: What are you rattling on about?

Percy: Cars are being harvested... Their brains are being dismantled and discarded. Their remains being occupied by these... things.

Wheely: This is ridiculous. He's just trying to stop us from turning him over to the Queen.

Wedge's brother: He's telling the truth.

Wheely: There's no way! That's absolutely insane!

Gearson: Wheely! Think about it! What did we just see out there? That thing that flew out of that poor car's face. 
 	This conveyor belt full of dead bodies that no one has addressed yet?! (turns toward conveyor belt with cars on it)
	This explains it all!

Tinaldo: If this is true... All of Overton is in danger. The whole planet! We have to notify the Queen!

Percy: You don't think I've tried? It's impossible to gain audience with the Queen right now.

Wheely: Even... for a Governor?

Gearson: I think I have a plan, gang.
