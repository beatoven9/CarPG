Shop Keeper 1: Oi Gearson! You son of a bike!
Shop Keeper 2: Gearson! Why I oughtta. Lot a nerve showin' your face around here.
Wheely: Wow! You do seem to be a regular around here, Governor.
Gov. Gearson: Why uh yes!.. This is like a second home to me! I suppose I should get back to work in Overton...
Wheely: Wait! Governor, can we ask for another favor?
Gov. Gearson: Go for your life, kid!
Wheely: Well we witnessed a car-napping the other day and we were looking for the perpetrator.
Gov. Gearson: Okayyy. What did this perpetrator look like?
Wheely: (Describes Percy)
Gov. Gearson: Your sticking your grill where it don't belong, kid.
Wheely: You know him? You have to tell us!
Gov. Gearson: And risk my gears? Forget about it!
Wheely: But we need to save my brother!
Gov. Gearson: It's your brother... ughh sorry, I can't help you.

// Gov. Gearson turns away. Wedge turns away

Gov. Gearson: His name is Percy.

// Wheely and Wedge turns back

Wheely: Percy who? Where can I find him?
Gov. Gearson: There's an old bar on the other side of town called the Rust Bucket. He's a regular there.
	But you didn't hear it from me!

// At this point if you lost the Race to the Rubble against Gov. Gearson, he will return back to Overton through the tunnel.
// If you won the race:

	Gov. Gearson: Hey kid, you really shouldn't be goin' down this path alone.
	Wheely: Well we have to do it somehow!
	Gov. Gearson: I know. That's why I'm going with you.

BAR_BOSS: Alright Gearson, that's how it's gonna be? On a normal day I'd just let you go with a simple beating
	but with this attitude... I'm gonna beatchya till ya leaking oil!

	(Commence boss fight)

	// Idle banter during fight?

BAR_BOSS: Okok! I give in! Just ease up! I'll tellya whatchya wanna know!
	There's a mechanic at the other side of town. Matthew and Sons. Matthew there
	will know where to find him.

Wheely: Whaddya mean? You're too chicken to tell us his location yourself??

BAR_BOSS: Naw naw, you got it all wrong! I don't know where he is. I hardly know the guy!

Wedge: Then why did you fight us when we came in here asking for him?

BAR_BOSS: Oh, I just like to fight. In fact!.. if you ever feel like practicing some new battle techniques,
	come talk to me!

// This character will be here from now on for you to fight against. He should level scale.
// Just for a testground for new abilities and such. losing will not result in game over just return to overworld

Wheely: ...
Wheely: Ok! Mechanic it is!

---scene ii---
// Travel to mechanic....
// Only one person inside, the Matthew's partner is in there

Wedge: Hey there! We were advised to speak with Matthew.

Sons: Ah, I apologize but Matthew isn't in at the moment. 
    But my name is Sons. I'm Matthew's business partner. And I can help you with anything you might need help with.

Wedge: Oh we appreciate it but we aren't here for mechanic services today.

Sons: Oh? Perhaps information is what you seek?

Wheely: You got it!

Sons: Well then. You're more than welcome to wait here for him.
Sons: However, I have some work that I could use help with.
	I bet by the time you're done with it, Matthew will be just getting back.
	And I'll put in a good word for you if you do a good job.

Wheely: What kinda work is it?...

Sons: It is... package retreival work.

Wheely: Ok, we aren't a delivery service!

Sons: Well these particular packages are in the possession of some unsavory characters. Stolen from me in fact.

Wheely: Ah, so you want us to knock some sense into a couple a thugs and get your goods back from them?

Sons: Precisely! I hoped you'd would be interested.

Wheely: Yeah! Of course we're interested!

Sons: Excellent! Take these Rollie-Talkies. I'll communicate to you through those. Each of the pieces has a proximity sensor
	synced with the rollie-Talkies so I'll know when you've picked up each piece.
	You first location is the hideout of the Underton Car Cartel. (Describes location)
	Best of luck! And I'll call you with updates as you progress.

	// Quest to collect parts that were stolen by thugs from Sons.
	// Sons will send you to various thug hideouts and call you after you obtain each item to tell you the
	// location of the next hideout to ransack.

Sons: Excellent work! Matthew just arrived a few minutes ago. He's out back and ready for you.
//player goes out back

Matthew: So, you all are the lot that took care of all of those thugs for Sons.
	What can I do for ya?

Wheely: We need to find Percy.

Matthew: Percy? What in the world would you wanna find Percy for?

Wheely: He's wanted for a carjacking!

Wedge: Yeah! He carjacked my little brother!

Matthew: Oh dear, then I guess you do need to find Percy, don't you?...
	Ok I'll tell ya what. Do take care of one more errand for us and I'll tell you exactly where he is.

Wheely: Deal!

Matthew: Ok, just east of town, there's a forest with some nasty CRITTERs in it. It has a path going through it
	that used to be a well traveled path for merchants but has been all but abandoned with the CRITTER altercations
	on the rise. Well anyway, my last trip through there I was attacked by fiends and lost all the contents of my trunk.
	I had some really useful tools in that lot. If you retreive that stuff for me, I'll let you know where Percy is.
	And there's something in there that I think might help you with your impending altercation with Percy.

Wheely: You've got it!

Matthew: Excellent! The tracking on the cargo is still functional so I'll mark its location on your map.

##################################################################
	Go in woods

	There will be a lake along the way that you pass by. When you get close enough to it, a character named Frogg
	exits the lake.
##################################################################

Frogg: Glib chierah pir dua aiutasa!
Wedge: What?
Frogg: Glib chi.. Glib chier... ughhhh!... Za slatsuzon ze roht!!
Wheely: I have no idea what he's saying...
Frogg: ... Me help you.
Wedge: Does you want to join us?
Frogg: (jumps up and down in agreement)

// Frogg joins the party.
// Get the cargo and go back to Matthew.

Matthew: Well done! I never thought I'd see this cargo again! and.... yes! Here it is! Gray blinker fuild!
Matthew: And it looks like you picked up a new friend along the way! (turns toward Frogg)
Matthew: This blinker fluid, when equipped will allow you to fight as a Black Mage and give you
	access to elemental magic.
Matthew: I think you'll find that a number of Percy's lackeys are vulnerable to lightning damage.
Matthew: To find him, you want to go to roof of the Rich Carlton. That's where he's hiding out.
Matthew: Best of luck and thank you again for all of your help today! You're welcome here anytime!

---close scene ii---


---scene iii---

##################################################################
	Drive to Rich Carlton.
	On each floor you'll fight a wave of enemies. The enemies will be weak to lightning or something related to
	the new class you can play as.
	Each floor should have a clearly displayed number so the player can keep track of how many floors are left.

	When you reach the top floor of the building, Percy and Tony are there ready to talk.
##################################################################

Percy: So you actually found us?

Wheely: You better bet! And now you're going down! Give us back Wedge's brother!

Percy: Hey Tony, I'll take care of these goons. Go tell the big man that we've been infiltrated then I'll meet you 
	at the safe house.

Tony: Sure thing Boss! On it.

// Tony wheels out for backup.

##################################################################
	Battle ensues
	As you kill him, the big evil's lackeys enter and stand in between you and Percy. Percy has a clear exit from the 
	building and he makes his departure and you need to fight the lackeys in order to leave but it gives you time to 
	heal after the Percy fight. Though the lackeys will be pretty easy comparatively. More just general goons.
	So Percy is given ample time to get away.
##################################################################

// After defeating the lackeys...

Wheely: Ugh! Now we're back to square one! We've got no lead on where his safe house is.

Gov Gearson: Don't give up hope so quickly! Your forgetting where we are. This is his hideout! And he definitely didn't
	have time to clean up before his exit. There might be some clues about where the safe house is.

// You search for clues.
// One desk you can interact with will say East-Westerton.

Wedge: East-Westerton? Where is that?

Gov Gearson: Ah, that's a neighborhood in the eastern part of Westerton, the town just west of Underton. I have an old friend in West-Westerton! We should meet up with him first.

// Wheel on over to East-Westerton
