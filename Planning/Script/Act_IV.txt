---Act IV---
---scene i---

// The team goes to the palace and talks to the guards.

Gov. Gearson: Hello there guards! We have very important matters that we need to discuss with the Queen.
Guard: We have strict orders not to let anyone through to see the Queen. Now beat it!
Gov. Gearson: That's hardly a way to talk to a Governor!
Guard: You have no jurisdiction here. Scram!

// The team leaves the palace

---close scene i---

---scene ii---

Wedge: Drat! What are we gonna do now?

Wheely: Well... we could always break in...

Percy: Good luck with that. This is the most heavily guarded palace on the planet.

Gearson: I think I might know a way in.

Wheely: That's what I'm talking about!

Percy: Don't get too excited kid, look where his last plan landed us.

Wheely: Yeah, yeah, very funny. I don't see you coming up with any plans. Go ahead Governor!

Gearson: There's an escape route that we used when I was in Parliment.
Gearson: We never used it and it's highly secret. I bet there aren't many guards stationed out there.
Gearson: The entrance is a cave just north of the mountain.

// The team enters through the north and comes to a locked door.

Gearson: Don't worry fellas, I got this. If the code is still the same....
Gearson: Dangit!! I figured they'd change the code. It's been a while.

Percy: You said that you had access when you were a member of Parliment?

Gearson: That's right...

Percy: Well then, my mechanic's partner, Sons, should know the code.

Wheely: Sons is a member of Parliment?

Percy: Ah, so you know him!

Wedge: Of course we know him! He had us running all around Underton running errands for him.

Percy: Sounds about right...
Percy: I think he and Matthew are about the only cars in Underton that would believe us and trust us with a code
	that important.

---close scene ii---

---scene iii---
// You get to Matthew and Sons and find that the place looks abandoned and ransacked

Wedge: What happened here?

Percy: This is not good. Look around for clues but stay on the alert.

Wedge: I hope Matthew and Sons are okay.

// Two heavily armed robots drop from the ceiling and battle you.

Wheely: Phew! That was close!

Matthew: (distant) Wheely?

// Matthew wheels out from behind somewhere.

Wheely: Matthew! You're alive!

Matthew: Barely! Thank you for dismantling the last of the assailants.

Wheely: All in a day's work! Now where's Sons? We need to speak with him.

Matthew: I'm afraid... They took him.

Gov. Gearson: Took him!!! Do you have any idea who did this?

Matthew: I don't know what it is. He wasn't like any car I'd seen, that's for sure.
Matthew: He was wearing a black robe and when he wheeled around, he made this ominous clacking sound.

Percy: BIG_BAD...
Percy: It seems that BIG_BAD had the same idea as we did about entering the palace through the escape route.

Matthew: The Queen's palace?? You've got to stop them! You might be able to catch up with them. They only left here
	a couple of minutes ago!

Wheely: Let's hit it fellas!!

---close scene iii---

---scene iv---

// You arrive at the door to the escape route only to see that the door is wide open.

Tony: Not good.

Percy: Not good at all, Tony.
Percy: We've gotta get in there before BIG_BAD gets to the Queen.

// You fight your way against BIG_BAD's henchman through the escape route all the way to the throne room.

---close scene iv---

---scene v---

// You enter the Queen's throne room.
// There are no guards and the Queen is silent.

Wedge: Thank God you're ok, your Majesty!

Percy: Where are all the guards?

Gearson: I have a bad feeling about this.

Wheely: Your majesty, we come to you with heavy hearts.
Wheely: For we have seen fellow cars reduced to shells of their former selves.
Wheely: Cars who have had their consciousnesses ripped out so their empty carcasses could 
	be sold on other planets to collectors.

// Music fades to silence. All is silent.

Queen: ...

Wheely: Your majesty?

// audible footsteps

BIG_BAD: She can't hear you, you know?
BIG_BAD: Unfortunately, your dear queen has also been reduced to... what were your words? An "empty carcass"?

Wheely: NOOOO!!!
All: // Shouts out of despair

BIG_BAD: And how fitting will it be for her to be the one to take you lot out of your misery?

Queen: YIEAHHHOOHSHSH!!!!!
// Queen starts bashing around and the whole room starts shaking.

Percy: We've gotta get out of here! This whole cave system is about to collapse!

	You race off to the exit.
	As you make it out of the cave, all party members kind of spread out a bit to catch their breath and ninja
	cars swoop in as dark blurs and carjack each one of the players. When PLAYER_CAR gets swooped, the screen goes black.
