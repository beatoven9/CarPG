The palace guards can't be normal cars. Maybe the blue cars are the palace guards. And the whole time the 
team thinks that they are imposters posing as palace guards.

Maybe BIG_BAD actually IS the queen's henchman. And he's been using his henchmen out and about. They are variations on
the palace guards. Maybe Palace Guards and BIG_BAD's henchmen are specially bred for fighting so they ARE allowed to harm 
cars.

---Act IV---
---scene i---

// the team goes to the palace and tries to use the Governor's influence to gain audience but it doesn't work.

---close scene i---

---scene ii---

Wedge: Drat! What are we gonna do now?

Wheely: Well... we could always break in...

Percy: Good luck with that. This is the most heavily guarded palace on the planet.

Gearson: I think I might know a way in.

Wheely: That's what I'm talking about!

Gearson: There's an escape route that we used when I was in Parliment.
Gearson: We never used it and it's highly secret. I bet there aren't many guards stationed out there.
Gearson: The entrance is a cave just north of the mountain.

// The team enters through the north and comes to a locked door.

Gearson: Don't worry fellas, I got this. If the code is still the same....
Gearson: Dangit!! I figured they'd change the code. It's been a while.

Percy: You said that you were given the code when you were a member of Parliment?

Gearson: That's right...

Percy: Well then, my mechanic's partner Sons should know the code.

Wheely: Sons is a member of Parliment?

Percy: Ah, so you know him!

Wedge: Of course we know him! He had us running all around Underton running errands for him.

Percy: Sounds about right...
Percy: I think he's the only car in Underton that would believe us and trust us with the codes.

---scene iii---
// You get to Matthew and Sons and find that the place looks abandoned and ransacked

Wedge: What happened here?

Percy: This is not good. Look around for clues but stay on the alert.

Wheely: I hope Matthew and Sons are okay.

// Two heavily armed robots drop from the ceiling and battle you.

Wheely: Phew! That was close!

Matthew: (distant) Wheely?

// Matthew wheels out from behind somewhere.

Wheely: Matthew! You're alive!

Matthew: Barely! Thank you for dismantling the last of the assailants.

Wheely: All in a day's work! Now where's Sons? We need to speak with him.

Matthew: I'm afraid... They took him.

Wedge: Took him!!! Do you have any idea who did this?

Matthew: I don't know what it is. He wasn't like any car I'd seen, that's for sure.
Matthew: He was wearing a black robe and when he wheeled around, he made this ominous clacking sound.

Percy: BIG_BAD...
Percy: It seems that BIG_BAD had the same idea as we did about entering the palace through the escape route.

Matthew: The Queen's palace?? You've got to stop them! You might be able to catch up with them. They only left here
	a couple of minutes ago!

Wheely: Let's hit it fellas!!

---close scene iii---

---scene iv---

// You arrive at the door to the escape route only to see that the door is wide open.

Tony: Not good.

Percy: Not good at all, Tony.
Percy: We've gotta get in there before BIG_BAD gets to the Queen.

// You fight your way against BIG_BAD's henchman through the escape route all the way to the throne room.

---close scene iv---

---scene v---



// You enter the Queen's throne room.
// There are no guards and the Queen is silent.

Wheely: Thank God you're ok, your Majesty!

Percy: Where are all the guards?

Gearson: I have a bad feeling about this.

Wheely: Your majesty, we come to you with heavy hearts.
Wheely: For we have seen fellow cars reduced to shells of their former selves.
Wheely: Cars who have had their consciousnesses ripped out so their empty carcasses could 
	be sold on other planets to collectors.

// Music fades to silence. All is silent.

Queen: ...

Wheely: Your majesty?

// audible footsteps, If I decide to make BIGBAD a humanoid

BIGBAD: She can't hear you, you know?
BIGBAD: Unfortunately, your dear queen has also been reduced to... what were your words? An "empty carcass"?

Wheely: NOOOO!!!
All: // Shouts out of despair

BIGBAD: And how fitting will it be for her to be the one to take you lot out of your misery?

// hand extends from cloak *snaps* 
// queen attacks

// you defeat the queen.
Queen: YIEAHHHOOHSHSH!!!!!
// Queen starts bashing around and the whole room starts shaking.

Percy: We've gotta get out of here! This whole cave system is about to collapse!

// You race off to the exit.
// As you make it out of the cave, all party members kind of spread out a bit to catch their breath and ninja
// cars swoop in as dark blurs and carjack each one of the players. When PLAYER_CAR gets swooped, the screen goes black.
