We need more development of the villain. We don't really get to see him being evil that much. in fact
we realy only get to see him 3 times. Once when he hits percy/takes away Carisco, once when he kills the queen,
and then once when we fight him as the final boss.

I think we can make him worse if he kills Carisco right during your second encounter. This would probably require
that we follow Wedge and Tinaldo's story simultaneously so that we can witness Tinaldo dealing with the grief and growing
from it. I think maybe a good way to do this would be that after Tinaldo and Tony break out, they go on a quest to
find some sort of weapon that was stolen from Carisco. Getting this weapon back will bring closure to Tinaldo and
it will keep Tinaldo away from the areas that Wedge and Wheely are exploring. Maybe Tinaldo can overhear where Gearson
and Percy are being kept and know that he needs the weapon to save Gearson and he needs Gearson to have a chance at
saving Percy.

We could also try to add another encounter or two with Jeremy. Perhaps right before Wheely breaks Wedge out, Jeremy
visits Wedge in jail to tell him his whole plan to break his spirits. 'The queen is dead, no hope for rebuilding.'
'wedge: I thought you wanted to make money on selling our shells!' 'Jeremy: How simple-minded. My plans are much grander 
than that.' And maybe it is something truly more evil than that or maybe it's something hilarious like he wants to destroy
the car market so that he can sell motorcycles. So he's going to see the planet to its end. Rule it into the ground 
from the Royal Palace which he has rebuilt so that he can live in luxury.

Jeremy is going to be a 'gift' from the humans. The Queen has entered into a relationship with the humans
to save Carkind. She knew that the humans would eventually extinguish them so she agreed to be complicit
in giving a certain amount of cars every year so the whole species wouldn't go extinct.

However, she tells everyone that Jeremy is someone that she's hired to 'investigate' the issues occuring.
	disappearances, critters going wild, etc

Dad doesn't go to see the Queen to find you're brother. You do. At the Palace, interacting with guards, you can overhear
them saying that the Queen isn't acting herself. 

Guard: Don't worry, I'm sure she's just stressed by the rise in Critter attacks.

Here is the first time that you meet Jeremy. He is a foreigner working for the Queen. The Queen does not believe 
you that anyone would kidnap your brother. Jeremy "defends" your position and insists to the Queen that he will
investigate the issue.

	Jeremy: My Queen, with the rise in recent disturbances, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that the inhibitor
		gene may be affected. I offer my services to your excellency to investigate this matter at once. (maybe he recognizes
		the description of the Percy.)

	Queen: What do you intend?

	Jeremy: I intend to investigate the Hive Core. To search for any evidence of irregularities.

	Queen: Very well. Take 4 Palace Guards with you and investigate the Hive Core.

But this doesn't go according to plan. An 'accident' happens in the Hive Core. Jeremy is the lone survivor and nothing 
is suspected by the Queen. However, it was orchestrated by Jeremy. He needed access to the Hive Core to completely
disengage the inhibitor chip.

	Wedge: I am eternally grateful that your excellency is taking my concerns seriously. My one last request is that
		we are given permission to access the blocked road near Train Road. This is where we suspect the Carjacker
		to have escaped with my brother.

	Queen: I will reiterate. We do not believe your brother to have been taken. Jeremy is being allowed to investigate
		the Hive Core as a precaution and as an act of good faith to his people. You will not be given permission to
		traverse this service road.

	Wedge: Thank you, your excellency.

		(exits)

	Wheely: So how are we gonna get past the blockade?

	Wedge: Get past the blockade? We can't get past the blockade. You heard her. She sounded serious.

	Wheely: But we both know that your brother was taken, and that's the only route they could've escaped down.
	Wheely: I suggest we try to get permission from a Government official.

	Wedge: Governor Gearson.

	Wheely: Great idea!

	Wedge: I don't think it's a great idea, but that's who we'd go to if we did want access to that road.

	Wheely: Well why don't we just stop by his office and explain the situation. The worst he can do is say 'No'.

	Wedge: Fair enough.

	(They go to Gearson's office.)

Also, it would be best if the party beats Percy and Tony to the hangar. Here they can investigate a bit and
find the dead Cars. When Percy and Tony walk in, the party hides.

When Percy and Tony attack Jeremy at the Hangar, Percy and Tony get out of their cars as proof that humans are in the cars.
Maybe Percy comes to the light when he begins to understand that even though the cars are a Swarm species, their sentience
is still present (despite what he's been conditioned to believe). And he comes to the light to defend the Cars.

Maybe Percy isn't even aware that the evil guy is percy since he wears a hood when talking with Percy. Jeremy is secretly
the leader of the humans who has infiltrated the planet and Royal Palace to take complete control of the species.
