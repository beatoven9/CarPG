##################################################################
	-Open to a scene of Wedge sitting in a jail cell.
	-Maybe there are lots of tally marks on the floor to show that it has been a really long time.
	-Suddenly there is a rumble and some noise and then a wall breaks open and 
	 Wheely wheels in.
##################################################################

Wheely: Hiya Wedge! Been a while!
Wedge: Wheely!! What's going on?
Wheely: Let's get out of here! I'll explain the rest once we get to safety at Matthew and Sons!

    // The pair leaves and finds refuge back at Matthew and Sons.

Matthew: Wedge! I'm so glad you're safe.

Wedge: If not for Wheely, I'd still be locked away. Where are the others?

Matthew: Still locked away I'm afraid... along with Sons.

Wheely: Jeremy locked us up for getting in the way of his coup. I broke out a couple days after that 
	day with the Queen and have been looking for everyone for the past few months. You're the first 
	person I've found.

Wedge: So we don't know where the others are yet?

Wheely: Well, I've got a lead on Gearson but my past couple leads have turned out to be dead ends.
	I think they're keeping Gearson at a remote Royal Outpost in the woods just North of Easterton.

Wedge: What are we waiting for? Let's investigate before they move him!

Wheely: Let's hit it!

--- close scene i ---

--- scene ii ----

    // While traveling through the woods you come across Frogg running away from a few Palace Guards.

Frogg: Blurghhhh!!!

Wheely: Hey! Leave our friend alone!

    // Frogg joins the party for a battle against the Palace Guards.

Frogg: Blurgha wurgha.

Wheely: Yup! My thoughts exactly. Now come help us save Gearson!

    // The team continues on to save Gearson

--- close scene ii ---

--- scene iii ---

    // The team approaches the Royal Outpost.

Wheely: Now stay on alert. These places used to be safe havens in the wilderness but now that
	Jeremy has taken over, they're extremely hostile. We're gonna have to fight our way through to
	Gearson's cell, if he's even in there.

    // The team fights the two Royal Guards outside and enter the Outpost fighting waves of
	enemies until they make it to Gearson's cell.

Gearson: Took you guys long enough!!

Wheely: Quit your moaning and help us find the other!

    // Upon exiting you hear but don't yet see Tinaldo and Tony

Tinaldo: Come on Tony! We've see if the intel was right! Gearson could be captive in here.

Tony: Bu-bu-but... That place is gonna be crawling with guards.

Tinaldo: It's the only chance we have of finding the others.

Wedge: Tinaldo? Tony?

    // Tinaldo and Tony wheel on from off-screen

Tinaldo: Fellas!! You've found Gearson!

Tony: Thank god! I did NOT want to fight those guards.

Gearson: Good to know you've got my back Tony...

Wedge: Tinaldo, do you have any idea where Percy is?

Tinaldo: yes...

Wheely: Right on! Let's go save him!

Tinaldo: Unfortunately it's not going to be that easy. He's being kept in the Royal Palace by Jeremy.
	Apparently, Jeremy had some special plans for him. And if you thought the palace was well guarded
	before, you're in for a surprise now. The place is a fortress since Jeremy has been using it as his
	stronghold.

Wheely: Well then... let's regroup back at Matthew and Sons and talk to Matthew. He might have some idea.

--- scene iv ---

##################################################################
	-Scene fades in and the group is at Matthew and Sons in mid
	 conversation with Matthew.
##################################################################


Matthew: Hmmm... have you heard of the prophecy of the Evil Bi-Wheel?

Tinaldo: The Evil what?

Matthew: Bi-Wheel. There's an old prophecy of an evil being that travels on it's back two wheels that
	comes, kills the queen, and attempts to reign over our planet. It's quite an obscure prophecy. But from
	what you tell me of this character, he seems to fit the description of the evil in the prophecy remarkably well.

Wheely: Well how do they kill him in the prophecy?

Matthew: Whoa! Hold your horsepower! The being in this particular story is an immortal. Incapable of being harmed
	by your standard combat.

Percy: That explains how he was able to so easily cast me aside when I tried to jump him.

Tinaldo: Well, if he's immortal, how come he's keeping the palace so heavily guarded? He must be afraid of SOMETHING!

Matthew: Hmmm... excellent point little one. I seem to recall another prophecy about an immortal evil. Let me see here.

    // Matthew wheels back and forth along his bookshelf.

Matthew: Ah here it is. Yes, the ancient magic! Of course! There is another prophecy of an ancient magic held in
	a cave. It can only be acquired by one true of heart with intentions of saving the planet. Wow! How fortuitous!
	That's you guys!

Wedge: Where do we find this cave?

Matthew: Well, it looks like it's (describes location of cave).

Wheely: Perfect! Let's go get that magic fellas!

    // Team goes to cave.

##################################################################
	-While exploring the cave, the team stumbles upon a large lake.
	-Frogg goes ballistic. 
	-Three beings who look exactly like Frogg emerge from the lake carrying an egg.
##################################################################

Being 1: Blurgha lurgha durgha burgh!

Wheely: Oh great!...

Being 1: (Turning to Being 2) Blurgha!

*Zzzt!*

Being 1: Hello? Ah much better. Sorry, my translator wasn't on. Good to see you again Frogg!

Wheely: Wait! You know Frogg?

Being 1: Why of course! We sent him to help you defeat Jeremy. Your planet is in grave danger.
	How goes the journey Frogg?

Frogg: Blurgha!

Being 1: Oh dear, it seems your translator has malfunctioned. You can have mine when I'm done telling
	these brave cars about the next steps in their journey.

Frogg: Blurghhhh....

Being 1: You have exceeded our expectations in every way so far my friends. But your final steps will not be easy.
	You must venture deeper into the cave to find the Well of Ancient Magic. Here your heart will be tested.
	Once you acquire the Ancient Magic, it alone will not stop Jeremy. It will merely lower his first layer
	of defenses and allow you to conduct battle with him. This will be no easy task. You will need to prepare well.

Tinaldo: That won't be a problem for us!!

Being 1: Ho Ho Ho!! That's the spirit! Now, there's one last thing. Regarding your queen. I understand that you murdered
	her before she was able to lay another Queen Egg.

Wheely: Hey! We didn't murder her! Jeremy was controlling her and made her attack us.

Being 1: Yes yes! no matter. The Queen has contracted us for situations just like this! She has put 4 Queen Eggs in
	our care to be given Wedge when the time is right.

Wedge: To... me?

Being 1: Yes of course! You're a very special car. Here is the Queen Egg.

Wheely: Wait, I thought you said that she gave you 4 eggs.

Being 1: Right, I gave the other 2 to travelers that I mistook for Wedge. Sorry, all cars look the same to our eyes.

Gearson: But that still leaves 1 Queen Egg unaccounted for.

Being 1: Yes, well when we still had 4 Eggs, we got hungry and figured that we could spare just one egg for a nice brunch.

!!!!!!!!

Being 1: Anyway! We're off! Send our best to the new Queen! And put in a good word for us! Here's your new translator, Frogg!

    // hands Frogg a translator and then the Beings quickly dive back into the water.

Percy: Well that was a trip...

Wheely: Tell me about it. Frogg, you knew this the whole time and you were trying to tell us about it?

    // Frogg trips while putting the translator on and breaks the new translator.

Frogg: Blurgh Dammit!!!!

##################################################################
	The team continues toward the Well of Ancient Magic and eventually comes upon a clearing with the well in the center.
	The cave shakes, the back closes and a horse-drawn carriage falls from the ceiling to battle.

	Once the battle ends, the horse-drawn carriage begins to talk to you
##################################################################

Horse: You have proven yourself worthy of the Ancient Magic. Now go and save our planet before it's too late!!

    // The team exits the cave

--- close scene iv ---

--- scene v ---

##################################################################
	The team travels to the Royal Palace.
	They have to fight their way past all the Palace Guards but they should be pretty easy by now.

	The team enters the throne room and Jeremy is sitting on the throne.
	Throne is laughably big compared to Jeremy
##################################################################

Wheely: Surrender now Jeremy!

Jeremy: Right, you think I'm afraid of you with my current powers. I could squash you like a tricycle.

Wedge: You should be afraid, we have the Ancient Magic!

Jeremy: Hahahah! And you think some antiquated magic will be my undoing?! Laughable!
	Sure, it will lower my first layer of defenses, but you still have to take me down!

    // Battle ensues

Jeremy: NOOOOOOO!!!!!

    // He fades away.

Wedge: Now, there's only one thing left to do...

    // Wedge puts the egg on the throne. It shakes once or twice and then a fully grown Queen springs out of the Egg.

All: Hurray!

    // Spinning around, confetti falling from sky, credits start to roll.
